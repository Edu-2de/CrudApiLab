# Node.js CRUD API Lab

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects built with Node.js, each designed to demonstrate CRUD operations and RESTful API concepts. The projects are ideal for learning, experimentation, and practicing API testing with tools like Postman.

## Projects Included

- **Simple User CRUD API**  
  Basic REST API to manage users (create, read, update, delete).

- **Product Inventory API**  
  Manage products with endpoints for inventory operations.

- **Task Manager API**  
  A simple to-do/task management API.

- *(More projects coming soon!)*

## Tech Stack

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (for API testing)

## How to Use

Each project is located in its own subfolder. To run a project:

```bash
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm start
```

Then, use Postman or any API client to test the endpoints as described in the project's documentation.

## API Testing

All APIs are designed to be tested with Postman. Sample Postman collections may be included in each project folder.
